A repository that contains all my Data Analytics and data Scientist Projects

If you enter to any project and for some reason it cannot be loaded and the messaged that appears is:

"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"

Then an alternative way to see the project is given in the next steps:

- Enter https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
- Copy the link of the project.
- Paste it on the nbviwer tab
- Press enter or Go!
- YOU CAN SEE THE PROJECT!
